Title: House in Somerset

----

Text: All that remained of this former rectory was the Grade II Listed coach house and walled gardens. The large house had burnt down in the 1940s and had never been rebuilt. We were enthusiastically supported by the conservation officer when we proposed building a new house on Georgian lines connected by a contemporary link to the coach house refurbished to provide ancillary accommodation.

The house is built of lime render on blockwork set in lime mortar to avoid the need for unsightly modern expansion joints. The timber sash windows are set within shuttered reveals to modulate the quality of light, with louvered external shutters. The proportions of the rooms are carefully considered to create both a cosy, yet impressive series of rooms., and the main staircase incorporates an oval cantilevered stair with a naturally lit dome over. Local Ham stone was used for coins, porch and fire surrounds, with a welsh slate roof and painted hardwood cornice.
