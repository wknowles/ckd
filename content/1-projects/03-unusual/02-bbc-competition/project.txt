Text: Developed in conjunction with a leading academic in the field, this highly innovative design uses water as a structural, thermal and acoustic solution for a portable structure allowing for construction at the mere turn of a tap.

1. inflatable structure using multilayer membrane fabrics
2. water as a structural material (water is incompressible)
3. water as an acoustic isolator (water has high mass)
4. water filled inflatable structure concept.allows for quick inflation and deflation, ideal.for movable architecture.
5. water filled walls provide thermal mass.and the water could be heated or cooled.to control the temperature of the space, as.required.

The clean exterior shape reflects the central apostrophe of the BBC Radio 4 logo and is based on leading edge technology, backed by independent university research.
