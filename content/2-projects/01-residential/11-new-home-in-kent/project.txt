Title: New Home in Kent

----

Text: Successfully granted planning approval on an environmentally sensitive site, this house has been designed to complement it's surroundings on the edge of a public park, while maximising sunlight and views on the small sloping site. The house has been set into the sloping bank with bedrooms at the lower level and the living rooms at the higher level to optimise the views, sunlight and air.

The project features several environmentally sensitive building technologies, including a green roof and solar hot water and power generation.
