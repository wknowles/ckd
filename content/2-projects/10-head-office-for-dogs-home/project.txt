Title: Headquarters for Battersea Dogs & Cats Home
----

Text: This building was designed to incorporate reception, offices, meeting rooms and boardroom functions at the front, with a full veterinary clinic to one side. We designed a ramp hall as an acoustic barrier to separate these activities from two four story kennel blocks at the rear where they overlook the railway lines.

Architects:
Martin Richmond and Charles Knowles
