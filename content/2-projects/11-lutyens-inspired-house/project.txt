Title: Lutyens Inspired House

----

Text: The client's enthusiasm for Sir Edwin Lutyens' work inspired the design of this house with its intricate long roofs and more formal entrance front. Set within woodland, the design attempts to respond to it's surroundings. A palate of stone, rendered hemp walls and cedar shingles intend to make this a low carbon, energy efficient house.
