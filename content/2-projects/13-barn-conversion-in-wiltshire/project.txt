Title: Barn Conversion in Wiltshire

----

Text: 

The barn was converted as part of the development of a farmhouse complex to provide a substantially enlarged main house connected to, and incorporating, the barn.

The structure was stripped back to the external walls, and the main trusses and purlins were carefully repaired or replaced with reclaimed local roof timbers, boarded and part thatched, part slated in an unusual combination. The thatcher could see the field from which his material had grown as he worked on the new roof. Bathroom and sleeping 'pods'¬ù were hung within the space and off the walls to maintain a clear view of the original volume. Oak joinery in a more contemporary style infill the existing openings in the stone walls.

An orangery was built to one side of the original house and to the other a similar design runs back to the barn to form a new elevation, purposefully designed to be low and unintrusive in order to satisfy planning restrictions.
