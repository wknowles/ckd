Title: West London House

----

Text:

### Before
This rear garden façade originally had a small low lean-to addition forming part of the kitchen. Located in West London in the Bedford Park Conservation Area, planning approval would have been difficult so we used our Permitted Development Rights under the Planning rules.

### After
We amended the lean to by adding this gable end to provide light and space for eating under cover within the garden. We prepared drawings to comply with Permitted Development, and introduced our client to a reliable builder we often use in these circumstances. Together they completed the work with no need for our further involvement, thus minimising our fees in order to make the project economically feasible for them.
