Title: Veterinary Clinic

----

Text: This fully equipped air conditioned building with consulting rooms, treatment rooms, an operating theatre and staff welfare facilities is provided with all the services normally associated with a hospital building.

A pleasant private working environment is created with high clerestory frameless glazing around the perimeter. With a large roof overhang, glare free reflected natural light bathes the interior and provides views out to sky and trees, privacy from the outside and shade from direct sun.

The materials palette is a cast stone plinth taking up the fall in ground level, with maintenance free mineralite render walls and a lead grey sarnafil roof.
