Title: New Cattery at Battersea

----

Text: The building was officially opened on 26th October 2010 by HRH The Duchess of Cornwall.

The project involved construction of a new highly sustainable four storey building, as an extension to the Existing Kent building on the site, constructed by the practice over a decade earlier.

The new building includes reception and waiting areas, meeting rooms and 83 cat pens with preparation areas and staff rooms. Existing clinic facilities in the Kent building have been refurbished as a part of the project, and extended into the new building. The new structure provides a pleasant environment for its feline residents as they await new owners, with highly insulated curtain-walling and self cleaning windows specifically sized and located to make the most of natural light for the cats.

Sustainability credentials are incorporated into the heart of this building, making use of a number of new renewable energy technologies and significantly reducing its carbon footprint. Solar thermal and photovoltaic panels provide up to half of the hot water required for the building and up to 11,000kWh of electricity, enough to heat all of the cat pens. A ground source borehole array below the building provides heat for the building in the winter and cooling in the summer through a network of pipes installed underground.
