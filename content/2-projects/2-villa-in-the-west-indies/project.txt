Title: Villa in the West Indies

----

Text: 

Designed for a small island called Carriacou, this villa takes full advantage of the cool breezes and outdoor living. Cross ventilation is encouraged by the absence of glass, instead wooden jalousies are used to control the flow of light, sun and air to all rooms that are designed to have them on two sides. Large shaded verandas allow living to spill over between inside and outside areas. Inside spaces have high vaulted ceilings and all water is collected from the roofs for reuse.

The sloping site is maximised by jutting out the living space at the higher entrance level to take advantage of the optimum views of other islands and to use the undercroft as further garden level open living space. Local timber and stone has been used with rough rendered surfaces throughout.
