Title: Reception Pavilion

----

Text: Designed as a pavilion within a mature landscape, with fine trees and a small lake and set within the green belt, this building acts as reception and offices. It is built into a bank and takes the visitor from car park level via a cantilevered stone staircase to the upper gallery level out into an open courtyard. This courtyard is an important element in the composition of this building with a second building, creating a pivotal point for the 45 degree offset in their orientation.

English oak boarding and stone were chosen to complement the country setting, with frameless glass corners to connect the interior seamlessly with the rural surroundings.
