Title: Underdown Barn

----

Text: This proposal is for a contemporary design, which brings leading edge sustainable design methods to the problem of retaining and re-using local vernacular rural buildings to provide housing where all the planning rules are essentially against development. Our objective is to restore an existing cow barn known as a shelter shed for use as a house with auxiliary work studio and cart lodge, and to construct an underground addition to the new house within the farmyard area, connected to the shelter shed and argue for exceptional planning approval.

We have developed an innovative modern design solution to complement the minimal simplicity of the traditional farm building on the site.  The design of the proposal is such that from most vantages, the new earth sheltered house areas will not be visible and the appearance of the proposal will be that of the repaired and converted shelter shed. 

The earth sheltered area of this house and the innovative re-use and fit-out of the existing shelter shed to the Passive House Standard is an example of how leading edge sustainable design principles can be applied with new methods of construction suitable for traditional farm buildings.
