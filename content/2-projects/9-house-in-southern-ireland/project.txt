Title: House in Southern Ireland

----

Text: 

Demolition of existing small farmhouse and complete rebuild.

Taking the precedent of the small Irish country house, we have used the existing palette of materials to enlarge it as if creating a miniature estate in the early twentieth century. The ancillary building provides a generous drawing room, designed in the spirit of an Edwardian billiard room and takes full advantage of the extensive views, whilst providing protection from the harsh weather.
